# Minithesis (Haskell)

This repository tracks an incremental port of [Minithesis](reference/README.md) from Python to Haskell. The project is Cabal-based and relies on Hspec for the canonical test suite while also offering a Tasty runner.

Porting is in progress; consult `PLAN.md` for the current roadmap and status updates.
