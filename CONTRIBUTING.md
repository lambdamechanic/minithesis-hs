# Contributing

This project ports the Python Minithesis reference implementation to Haskell in small, reviewable steps. Please keep the Hspec suite authoritative and port the Python tests graduallyâ€”mark each Python test with `-- PORTED` once the equivalent Haskell coverage exists.

## Branching Workflow

1. `git fetch origin --prune && git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`
2. Create a feature branch from the updated `main`, e.g. `git checkout -b port/<topic>`.

## Local Checks Before Every Commit

- `make format`
- `hlint $(git ls-files '*.hs')`
- `cabal test all --test-show-details=direct`
- `cabal check`

Aim for red/green commits: push a failing regression test first, then follow up with the fix in a separate commit so CI documents the transition.

## CI Configuration

The GitHub workflow uses `haskell-actions/setup` v2 and caches Cabal with the latest `actions/cache` release. Example-only suites are guarded by the `ci-tests` Cabal flag to keep regular builds lean.

See `AGENTS.md` for the full set of working agreements and collaboration conventions.
